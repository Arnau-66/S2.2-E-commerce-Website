# SPRINT 2.2 E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

This project is part of the IT Academy Bootcamp and consists of developing a functional e-commerce website starting from a base HTML and CSS template.

## Description

Given an initial codebase, the goal is to complete the missing JavaScript logic and adapt the HTML structure to make the application fully functional. The resulting website allows users to:

- Select and view products.
- Add items to the shopping cart.
- Apply specific discounts based on quantity and product type.
- Remove individual items from the cart.
- Navigate to the checkout page and fill in personal details.
- Validate form inputs before submission.
- Finally, adjust the visual design and layout to create a more professional and polished appearance.

## Branch Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `main`: The primary branch.
- `Developer`: The working branch for overall development.
- `Exercici1` to `Exercici8`: Each branch represents the progress and solution of each specific exercise within the project.

## Technologies Used
