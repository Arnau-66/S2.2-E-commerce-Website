# SPRINT 2.2 E-COMMERCE WEBSITE

This branch (`Developer`) contains the in-progress development of an e-commerce website based on a starter HTML/CSS template.

The goal is to complete and connect the JavaScript functionality with the UI, enabling:

- Product selection and cart updates
- Discounts based on quantity
- Cart item removal
- Checkout form validation
- Basic styling improvements

Each feature has been implemented step-by-step across dedicated branches (`Exercici1` to `Exercici8`).
